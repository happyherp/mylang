mylang
======

An interpreter for an imperative programming language wriiten in haskell. 

The defintion of the language changes as I develop it. This is my second attempt at letting a programming language come to life. This project is quite late already. The runtime is more or less done and i am almost dont with the syntax/parser also. Let's see how this turns out!
