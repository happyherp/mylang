- remove stack-type as it is not needed the way calls work right now
- Permit \r\n as separator everywhere spaces are permitted
- Console Read/Write
- Interactive shell
- run script-files
- write a tool that checks if a given syntax is always unambigious.
- garbage collection
- better return statement
