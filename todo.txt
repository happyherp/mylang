Things I should add:
- remove stack-type as it is not needed the way calls work right now
- Permit \r\n as separator everywhere spaces are permitted
- Console Read/Write
- Interactive shell
- run script-files
- write a tool that checks if a given syntax is always unambigious.
- garbage collection

inwork:
-way to make rekursion work. current idea is some kind of let-statement that binds multiple things "at once"

done:
- bind lambda-expressions to current state and run them in it, when they get called.
